# [Promise](https://www.promisejs.org/) examples

Demonstrates how Promises can be used to simplify async operations. Browsers don't allow you to do requests to `file://` URLs (for security reasons), so you need to create a local server to run them.

```bash
cd <this directory>
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
open http://localhost:8000/FILENAME.html
```
