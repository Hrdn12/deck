# Instagram API demo

This demo makes a request to the Instagram API to retrieve current popular images, and display them on the page. Take a look at:

* [`index.html`](index.html)
* [Instagram's `GET /media/popular` API documentation](https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/media/#get_media_popular)
    * Note that this endpoint (conveniently) doesn't require [authentication](https://instagram.com/developer/authentication/)
