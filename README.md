## Course Description

Learn best practices in JavaScript in this intensive, five-session course. Topics include data encapsulation, closures, binding, inheritance, and name spacing. Discover some of the lesser-known, yet useful, features of the language, such as how to debug JavaScript problems on different browsers and improve performance. Create interactive webpages using third-party JavaScript libraries.

Computers are provided in the lab, though you are encouraged to bring a laptop for in-class exercises if you feel more comfortable coding in your own environment.

## Prerequisites

* [INFO1-CE9755 - JavaScript](http://scps.nyu.edu/content/scps/academics/course_detail.html?id=INFO1-CE9755) ([syllabus](https://github.com/advanced-js/syllabus/blob/master/vendor/INFO1-CE9755%20JavaScript.pdf?raw=true)) or equivalent
* Understanding of variables, data types, control flow, and basic function usage in JavaScript - see [Beginner Materials](#beginner-materials)
* Strong intermediate knowledge of HTML, and at least basics of CSS
* Basic jQuery knowledge (DOM interaction) is a plus

These won't be enforced by the instructor, but you will be pretty lost without understanding those concepts.

## Course Overview

We will dive into the nuances of JavaScript, how prototypal inheritance compares to classical inheritance, and how this can be used to build dynamic and complex web applications.  Modern tools like jQuery and BackboneJS will be discussed, but students will learn the building blocks of these frameworks and after this course be able to understand what is happening under the hood.  The focus will be on development for browsers, though most applies to other systems like Node.js, Phonegap, etc.  Topics covered include:

* Encapsulation, closures and scope
* Classical vs. prototypal inheritance
* The event loop
* AJAX and JSONP
    * local
    * remote (e.g. Foursquare)
* Creating MVC-style models (a'la Backbone.js) from scratch
* Test- and Pseudocode-Driven Development

Topics will be demonstrated through live-code examples/slides, available at [advanced-js.github.io/syllabus](http://advanced-js.github.io/syllabus/).  Additional exercises will completed in-class.

See [this interview](http://masterstreet.wordpress.com/2013/09/05/interview-with-aidan-feldman-instructor-at-nyu-scps/) for more background.

## Homework/Projects

All assignments are listed within the [Course Outline](#course-outline).

### Submission

Submit homework and projects via [NYU Classes](https://newclasses.nyu.edu) by the start of the following class.  Submissions can be in one of the following formats:

* A link to the code hosted live (preferred), e.g.
    * On your own site
    * [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) ([add'l guide](http://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/))
    * An online sandbox (see [tools](#tools))
        * These are great for small bits of code like the in-class exercises, but not things that are more substantial, like projects.  Better to have files split up and organized in directories for those, which sandbox sites (to my knowledge) don't offer.
* A self-contained, runnable ZIP (HTML included)

***Do not just copy-and-paste the code into the submission form.***

### Requirements

These apply to real life, as well.

* All HTML files should pass [W3C Markup Validation](http://validator.w3.org/)
* All written JS should pass [JSHint](http://jshint.com/)
* Must apply "good programming style" learned in class
    * Functions should be "short" (see [Sandi Metz's rules for developers](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/50655960596/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers))
    * Optimize for readability
    * For projects, use Object-Oriented Programming
* Bonus points for:
    * [Automated tests](#test-frameworks)
    * Creativity (as long as requirements are fulfilled)

## Projects

Possible projects are listed [here](projects).

## Pairing Tips

* Three people is possible, but two works best
* Agree on an editor and environment that you're both comfortable with
* The person who's less experienced/comfortable should have more keyboard time
* Switch who's "driving" regularly
* Make sure to save the code and send it to both people
* [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/) supports live collaborating

## Statements on Plagarism

### SCPS

> New York University takes plagiarism very seriously and regards it as a form of fraud.  The definition of plagiarism that has been adopted by the School of Continuing and Professional Studies is as follows: "Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work as though it were one's own.  More specifically, plagiarism is to present as one's own words quoted without quotation marks from another writer; a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work; or facts or ideas gathered, organized, and reported by someone else, orally and/or in writing.  Since plagiarism is a matter of fact, not of the student's intention, it is crucial that acknowledgement of the sources be accurate and complete.  Even where there is not a conscious intention to deceive, the failure to make appropriate acknowledgement constitutes plagiarism.  Penalties for plagiarism range from failure for a paper or course to dismissal from the University.

### Instructor

Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development.  As a professional programmer you will never write anything from scratch.  Please respect the terms of use and/or license, and if you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.
